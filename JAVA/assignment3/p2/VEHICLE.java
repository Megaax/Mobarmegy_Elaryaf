Create a class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type String), 
number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type String). 
Then, create a class called Truck that is a child of Vehicle and has the following 
additional properties: the load capacity in tons (type double) and towing capacity in pound (type int)
. Be sure your class has a constructor a, function to set values of class variables, and another one to get their values.
Write a main function to test all functions in Vehicle and Truck classes.
